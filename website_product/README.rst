This module extends the functionality of the website to support viewing
a specific product that has been published, but it is not caught by website_sale
because is not salable.

With this module all products can potentially be published to the website.

**Table of contents**

Usage
=====

* Go to the Product form in the backend and press the button 'Unpublished On Website'.
  You will be redirected to the website, in the form view of that product.

* If the product is sealable the user will display the shopping options.
  Otherwise a simple form is displayed, with no option to purchase.


This module per se does not do more than that, and other modules such as
'cms_product_form' from the website-cms OCA repository make use of this module.
